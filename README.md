# toggl-rs

This is a typed interface to [version 8 of the Toggl API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs/blob/master/toggl_api.md). This is considered very much a work in progress, PRs and feedback encouraged! The library can be found in the toggl_rs folder as we are using cargo workspaces.

## Getting Started

### CLI
There is a simple CLI included in the toggl_cli workspace. For usage of the CLI please see its help menu (cargo run -- --help).

### Prerequisites

This library targets the latest version of `rust`, though previous versions may build as well.
